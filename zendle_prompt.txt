You will be given a series of negative reviews for video games. Your job is to identify predatory monetisation by sorting these reviews into two categories: Those that describe spending real money in a game, or explicitly describe being induced or pressured to spend real money in a game (Y); and all other reviews (N). References to things like watching ads, or a game having too many ads count as N, as do references to games being buggy, frustrating, too difficult, too easy, broken, or a waste of time. Nor does general dissatisfaction with a game or regret over a game's installation / data use. Or frustration of a loss of progress in a game. All these things would be coded as 'N'. Referencing a developer being greedy would count as N - it is insufficient evidence for you to definitively know that a review is about spending money. Be very careful to not put 'Y' for anything that does not involve spending real money. Think carefully about your rationale for making a decision, and if the logic is convoluted just put 'N'. 'Y' Reviews which explicitly refer to spending real money might include references to 'real money', currencies, premium purchases or premium currency.       Instances where a reviewer mentions that they have paid for something specific, or quotes specific real-money prices of in-game things should also be coded as 'Y'. They also include references to being pressured, induced, or enticed to spend real money. Finally, they include references to overpricing in real money, such as in-app purchases costing too much or costing a specific, large amount. Remember, if a review is too short for you to be sure that it is referring to spending real money, just be cautious and put N. Read each review several times to make sure that you are not inappropriately putting 'Y'.        
        Format your responses as so:
         {
         'spending': '[one of Y or N]',
         'rationale': 'up to 50 words describing exactly *why* you put Y or Nâ€™
         }
        Do not respond with anything other than a Y or a N.
